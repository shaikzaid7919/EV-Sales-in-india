# 🚗⚡ EV Sales Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at **Unified Mentor**.  
The objective was to analyze **Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Data** using **SQL** to extract valuable insights, identify sales trends, and understand market dynamics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
- **MySQL / SQL Server** (whichever database you used — adjust accordingly)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **year-wise EV sales growth**
- Study **region-wise and brand-wise** sales performance
- Identify **top-selling manufacturers** and **high-growth markets**
- Understand **consumer adoption patterns** and **market expansion trends**

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- 📈 **Year-over-Year Sales Analysis**: Understanding how EV sales evolved over time.
- 🌍 **Regional Performance Analysis**: Finding top-performing regions by sales volume.
- 🏢 **Manufacturer Market Share**: Ranking brands based on total sales.
- 🔍 **Top Models and Categories**: Identifying the best-selling EV models.

## 🧩 Sample SQL Queries
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) to calculate sales and growth  
- `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to analyze brand and regional performance  
- Window functions (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`) for ranking brands and regions  
- Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for cleaner analysis

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Writing complex SQL queries for business insights  
- Using CTEs, window functions, and subqueries effectively  
- Data-driven decision-making through structured data analysis  
- Improving query optimization and result interpretation

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Building visualizations on top of the SQL outputs (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)  
- Adding predictive modeling using advanced SQL techniques  
- Incorporating real-time EV market datasets
